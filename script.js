// This is the basic outline for the day planner homework

// The top of the calendar will display

    // the current day, and time if I can swing it

// display standard business hours from 9am to 5pm

// each time slot should represent one hour and contain

    // the time, on the far left

    // a field to hold user imput
    
        // this background will change based on the time of day,
        
        // indicating wether or not this time has passed
        
        // use this to indicate also if the event is current or upcoming.
        
        // also change based on wheter the hour is free or filled.
        
        // use the Moment.js library for this, read docs carefully
    
    // a save button to the right of each time slot
    
        // clicking on this save button saves the user input to localStorage
